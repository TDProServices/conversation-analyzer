## 🐛 Bugs

### Issue #1: License placeholder needs confirmation

**Labels:** `bug`, `documentation`, `priority:low`

**Description:**
The MIT License is currently used as a placeholder in both `pyproject.toml` and `LICENSE` file, but hasn't been confirmed by the project owner.

**Current State:**
- `pyproject.toml` line 11: `license = {text = "MIT"}`
- `LICENSE` file created with MIT license text
- Comment in pyproject.toml: `# TODO: Confirm license choice with user`

**Expected:**
Confirmed license choice (MIT, Apache 2.0, GPL, proprietary, etc.)

**Impact:**
- Can't officially publish to PyPI without confirmed license
- Contributors don't know terms

**Action Needed:**
- [ ] User confirms MIT is correct, OR
- [ ] User specifies different license
- [ ] Update `LICENSE` file if needed
- [ ] Update `pyproject.toml`
- [ ] Remove TODO comment

**Priority:** Low (doesn't block development)

---

### Issue #2: Email placeholder in project metadata

**Labels:** `bug`, `configuration`, `priority:low`

**Description:**
Project uses `[email protected]` as placeholder email in `pyproject.toml`.

**Current State:**
- `pyproject.toml` line 9: `{name = "Tanya Davis", email = "[email protected]"}`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` line 198: References same email

**Expected:**
Real contact email for package metadata

**Impact:**
- Package metadata on PyPI would have placeholder email
- Users can't contact maintainer properly

**Action Needed:**
- [ ] User provides real email address
- [ ] Update `pyproject.toml` authors section
- [ ] Update `CONTRIBUTING.md` contact section

**Priority:** Low (doesn't block development, only affects publishing)

---

### Issue #3: CLI commands not implemented (scaffolded only)

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `priority:high`, `phase:4`

**Description:**
All CLI commands (`analyze`, `scan`, `report`, `check`) are scaffolded but not implemented. Running them shows "⚠️ Implementation pending (Phase 4)".

**Current State:**
- `src/conversation_analyzer/cli.py` has command structure
- All commands return placeholder messages
- Tests exist for command registration but not functionality

**Expected:**
Fully functional commands that perform actual analysis

**Implementation Plan:**
See TODO.md "Phase 4: MVP implementation" for full breakdown:
1. Implement conversation parser (using mistune)
2. Implement Ollama integration (using ollama library)
3. Implement TODO/bug extractor (hybrid: regex + LLM)
4. Implement SQLite database layer
5. Implement report generator (Markdown output)

**Priority:** High (core functionality)

**Estimated Effort:** 6-8 hours

**Blocked By:** None (research complete, structure ready)

## ✨ Features

### Issue #4: Pattern-based project suggestions

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `feature`, `priority:medium`, `phase:5`

**Description:**
Detect repeated manual tasks in conversations and suggest automation projects.

**Use Case:**
If user mentions "I manually process emails 3x/week" across multiple conversations, the tool should suggest: "Consider automating email processing" with a generated project brief.

**Implementation Notes:**
- Track frequency of pain points mentioned
- Cluster similar complaints using LLM semantic understanding
- Generate project briefs automatically when pattern detected (3+ mentions)
- Include context from conversations where mentioned

**Requirements:**
- Deduplication logic (to avoid counting same mention multiple times)
- Semantic clustering (not just keyword matching)
- Confidence scoring (how sure are we this is a real pattern?)

**Priority:** Medium

**Phase:** 5 (after MVP)

**Related:** Feature request #7 (confidence scoring)

---

### Issue #5: Confidence scoring for extracted items

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `feature`, `priority:high`, `phase:5`

**Description:**
Rate confidence in each extracted TODO/bug/feature (0-100%) to help user prioritize review.

**Use Cases:**
- Explicit TODO marker (`TODO:`) = 95-100% confidence
- "I need to..." = 80-90% confidence
- "We should probably..." = 60-75% confidence
- Vague mention = 40-60% confidence

**Implementation Notes:**
- Explicit markers (TODO:, FIXME:, BUG:) = high confidence
- Imperative sentences ("I will...", "I need to...") = medium-high confidence
- Conditional statements ("should", "could", "might") = medium confidence
- Questions about issues = medium-low confidence
- LLM can help score ambiguous cases

**Output:**
```markdown
### High Confidence TODOs (90%+)
1. [95%] Fix authentication bug (TODO: explicitly marked)
2. [92%] Add tests for parser ("I need to add tests" - clear commitment)

### Medium Confidence TODOs (60-89%)
1. [75%] Consider caching ("we should probably cache results")
2. [68%] Improve error messages ("could be better")
```

**Priority:** High (helps users trust the tool)

**Phase:** 5 (needs core extraction working first)

---

### Issue #6: Multi-format report output

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `feature`, `priority:low`, `phase:4`

**Description:**
Support multiple report formats beyond Markdown.

**Formats:**
- **Markdown** (default): Human-readable, git-friendly
- **JSON**: Machine-readable, API integration
- **HTML**: Pretty viewing in browser
- **CSV**: Spreadsheet import for tracking

**Current State:**
- CLI already has `--format` flag scaffolded
- Only Markdown planned initially

**Implementation:**
```python
# reporter.py
class ReportGenerator:
    def generate_markdown(self, findings):
        ...

    def generate_json(self, findings):
        ...

    def generate_html(self, findings):
        # Use Jinja2 template
        ...

    def generate_csv(self, findings):
        ...
```

**Priority:** Low (Markdown sufficient for MVP)

**Phase:** 4 or 5

---

### Issue #7: Deduplication across conversations

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `feature`, `priority:high`, `phase:5`

**Description:**
Avoid reporting the same TODO multiple times when it appears in different conversations or files.

**Scenario:**
- Conversation 1 (2025-11-15): "I need to fix the authentication bug"
- Conversation 2 (2025-11-16): "Still need to fix that auth bug"
- Conversation 3 (2025-11-17): "TODO: Fix authentication issue"

**Expected:**
Report as ONE item with:
- First mentioned: 2025-11-15
- Last mentioned: 2025-11-17
- Frequency: 3 occurrences
- Confidence: High (multiple mentions + explicit TODO marker)

**Algorithm:**
1. Exact match: Same text = duplicate
2. Fuzzy match: >80% similar = likely duplicate
3. Semantic match: LLM determines if same intent = duplicate

**Configuration** (.conversation-analyzer.yaml):
```yaml
deduplication:
  similarity_threshold: 80  # percent
  time_window_days: 7       # dedupe within window
  strategy: "semantic"      # exact, fuzzy, or semantic
```

**Priority:** High (prevents noise in reports)

**Phase:** 5 (after basic extraction works)

**Related:** Issue #5 (confidence scoring)

---

### Issue #8: Priority scoring for extracted items

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `feature`, `priority:high`, `phase:5`

**Description:**
Automatically score priority of extracted items based on context, urgency keywords, and impact.

**Scoring Factors:**
1. **Urgency keywords (40% weight):**
   - "critical", "urgent", "asap", "blocking" → High priority
   - "soon", "important" → Medium priority
   - "eventually", "someday" → Low priority

2. **Impact keywords (30% weight):**
   - "crash", "broken", "data loss", "security" → High impact
   - "slow", "confusing", "annoying" → Medium impact
   - "nice to have", "polish" → Low impact

3. **Frequency (20% weight):**
   - Mentioned 5+ times → High priority
   - Mentioned 2-4 times → Medium priority
   - Mentioned once → Priority depends on keywords

4. **Recency (10% weight):**
   - Last 7 days → boost priority
   - Last 30 days → neutral
   - Older → reduce priority

**Output:**
```markdown
## 🔴 High Priority (8 items)
1. [CRITICAL] Fix authentication crash - mentioned 3x, last: 2 days ago
   Source: auth-bug.md:42, conversation-2025-11-15.md:156

## 🟡 Medium Priority (12 items)
...

## 🟢 Low Priority (5 items)
...
```

**Configuration** (.conversation-analyzer.yaml):
```yaml
priority:
  weights:
    urgency: 0.4
    impact: 0.3
    frequency: 0.2
    recency: 0.1
  urgency_keywords:
    - critical
    - urgent
    - asap
```

**Priority:** High (helps users focus on important items)

**Phase:** 5

### Issue #9: Real-time directory watching

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `feature`, `priority:low`, `backlog`

**Description:**
Watch directories for new conversations and automatically analyze them.

**Use Case:**
User wants continuous analysis without manually running scan command.

```bash
# Watch mode
conversation-analyzer watch ~/Documents/Projects

# Watches for:
# - New .md files
# - Modified TODO.md files
# - New Claude Code conversation exports
```

**Implementation:**
- Use `watchdog` library for file system events
- Debounce (wait 5s after last change before analyzing)
- Incremental analysis (only analyze new/changed files)

**Priority:** Low (nice to have, not essential)

**Phase:** Backlog (after MVP working well)

---

### Issue #10: GitHub issue creation integration

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `feature`, `priority:low`, `backlog`

**Description:**
Automatically create GitHub issues from discovered high-priority TODOs.

**Use Case:**
```bash
# Generate report and create issues
conversation-analyzer report --create-issues

# Creates GitHub issues for high-priority items with:
# - Title from TODO description
# - Body with context/source
# - Labels (bug, enhancement, etc.)
# - Link to source conversation
```

**Implementation:**
- Use `gh` CLI for issue creation
- Map item types to labels (TODO → enhancement, BUG → bug)
- Include source references in issue body
- Handle rate limiting (max 20 issues per run)
- Dry-run mode to preview before creating

**Configuration:**
```yaml
github:
  create_issues: true
  priority_threshold: "high"  # only high priority
  labels:
    todo: "enhancement"
    bug: "bug"
    feature: "feature-request"
```

**Priority:** Low (manual review preferred initially)

**Phase:** Backlog

---

### Issue #11: Support for other conversation formats

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `feature`, `priority:low`, `backlog`

**Description:**
Parse conversation exports from ChatGPT, Gemini, and other AI assistants.

**Formats to Support:**
- ChatGPT JSON export
- Google Gemini exports
- GitHub Copilot Chat logs
- Generic markdown conversations

**Implementation:**
- Pluggable parser architecture
- Auto-detect format based on file structure
- Convert all formats to common internal representation

**Priority:** Low (focus on Claude Code first)

**Phase:** Backlog (only if user requests)

---

## 🔧 Enhancements

### Issue #12: Add CI/CD workflow

**Labels:** `infrastructure`, `ci/cd`, `priority:medium`

**Description:**
Add GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing and quality checks.

**.github/workflows/ci.yml:**
```yaml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -e ".[dev]"
      - name: Run linters
        run: |
          ruff check src/
          black --check src/
          mypy src/
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          pytest --cov=src --cov-report=xml
      - name: Upload coverage
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```

**Priority:** Medium (good practice, not urgent)

**Phase:** After Phase 4 (when there's code to test)

---

### Issue #13: Add example conversation files

**Labels:** `documentation`, `examples`, `priority:medium`

**Description:**
Provide example conversation files for testing and demonstration.

**Examples to include:**
1. **basic-todo-extraction.md**: Simple conversation with explicit TODOs
2. **implicit-todos.md**: Conversation with "should", "need to", etc.
3. **bug-report.md**: Conversation discussing bugs
4. **feature-discussion.md**: Conversation about features
5. **mixed-conversation.md**: Real-world example with TODOs, bugs, features

**Location:** `examples/conversations/`

**Purpose:**
- Users can test the tool without their own data
